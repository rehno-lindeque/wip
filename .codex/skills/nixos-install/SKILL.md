# NixOS Install (incremental)

Start here; branch into sub-skills (e.g., `apple-silicon`) when the hardware requires it.

Meta: only record steps we have actually performed; after each new verified step, update this skill or the appropriate sub-skill.

## Steps we have confirmed
- Hardware-specific install commands live in sub-skills (e.g., see `apple-silicon` for macbookpro2025).

## To-do (fill in after we perform them)
- Entirely replace our hacky installer with the declarative approach described by Michael Stapelberg (2025-06-01) for new systems: https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-06-01-nixos-installation-declarative/ — adopt once we’ve run it end-to-end.
- ARM/PinePhone installer

- See sub-skill references (e.g., `apple-silicon/links.md`) and open only when blocked.
